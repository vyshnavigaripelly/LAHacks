#### _Safely_ is a social-based pandemic monitoring application which tracks the spreading of deceases on a neighborhood scale.

# Features
- Allows users to report their own condition, be it healthy, symptomatic, diagnosed or recovered. Their health status can always be updated.
- Map indicating regions where symptomatic and diagnosed people are located. This allows users to see what areas around them are at high risk for contagion.

# Usage
First, the user must sign in, and if he doesn't already have an account, he must register on the application. <br>

Once the user has correctly entered his/her credentials, he/she will land on a status page, where he/she will be asked about his/her health status. <br> <br>

<br><br>
The answer given will be stored in the database, and the user will be directed toward the map, which is the principal feature of the application. The map shows the area in which there are people that are either symptomatic, or diagnosed with COVID-19.
